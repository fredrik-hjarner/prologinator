# Banned Tokens in Prolog Files

Instead of the banned tokens, use CLP(Z) constraints:

- Instead of `is`: Use CLP(Z) constraints like `#=` for equality
- Instead of `<`: Use `#<` from CLP(Z)
- Instead of `>`: Use `#>` from CLP(Z)
- Instead of `=<`: Use `#=<` from CLP(Z)
- Instead of `>=`: Use `#>=` from CLP(Z)

# Max 60 characters per line

Yes.
